Question 1: PAOLA as autonomous worker and expert consultant.
Question 2: Yes, formulation, or better called mathematical modeling, should be an important featured enabled by paola. I especially like the core capabilities + infrastructure that you proposed: 
    Core Capabilities:
    1. FORMULATION EXPERTISE (Point 1)
       - Natural language → mathematical model
       - Practical problem → optimization formulation
       - Agent's modeling intelligence

    2. OPTIMIZER EXPERTISE (Point 2)
       - 30+ algorithms across 6 libraries
       - Agent's selection intelligence
       - Agent's configuration expertise

    3. LEARNING INFRASTRUCTURE (Point 3)
       - Foundry (data foundation)
       - Knowledge base (experience accumulation)
       - Analysis (metrics + AI insights)

    Interface Layer: (Point 4)
    - CLI, Python SDK, Web UI
    - "Helpful interfacing" to user's problems

Question 3: Both.paola should primarily be a expert autonomous worker, but later on we should allow user to interfere in the working process and steer the workflow, i.e., much like claude code.
Question 4: Value proposition: expertise, we go back to the first principle: paola is the agent for solving optimization problems.
Question 5, Regarding "practical problem": Not necessarily. For two reasons: a) it requires substantial development in paola to ensure a good math modeling for practical problems, because they are highly diverse and complicated. We cannot be sure that paola is better than first-place engineers. b) I think the majority of the first users of paola already have certain optimization formulation that they want to test with. So, in this regard, easy set up to interfacing with their problem to paola is more important. I.e., if a user has a problem and he doesnt know/want to find and implement an optimization for it. How easy can the user uses paola to solve his problem.
